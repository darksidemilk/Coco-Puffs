      # Overview

      This package installs the latest Nvidia Studio Driver (aka the creator ready driver) for Windows 10/11 with the default settings. This driver also works with most Quadro cards.
      You can automate driver updates with `choco upgrade nvidia-studio-driver -y` in a scheduled task.
      You can revert to previous driver versions with `choco install` and specifying the version. i.e. `choco install nvidia-studio-driver --version=581.29 -yf`

      # Package Parameters

      The following package parameters can be set to customize the installation with custom behavior.

      * `/SkipCompatCheck` - Skip the compatibility check that ensures your GPU is supported by this driver version. Use at your own risk.
      * `/RemoveOtherVersions` - If desired, remove other versions of the NVIDIA display driver from windows after install. Can trigger an unexpected reboot (uncommon), 
        removes any nvidia display driver that doesn't match the version of the newly installed version, only effects display driver other components are untouched.
        Can help prevent windows from reverting to a 'newer' driver on reboot if reverting to an older version of the driver.

      Example param usage with choco install command:
      `choco install nvidia-studio-driver --params "'/RemoveOtherVersions'"`
