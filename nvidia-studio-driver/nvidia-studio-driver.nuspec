  - `/SkipCompatCheck` - Skip the compatibility check that ensures your GPU is supported by this driver version. Use at your own risk.
  - `/RemoveOtherVersions` - If desired, remove other versions of the NVIDIA display driver from windows after install.
    - Can trigger an unexpected reboot (uncommon)
    - Removes any nvidia display driver that doesn't match the version of the newly installed version, only affects display driver other components are untouched.
