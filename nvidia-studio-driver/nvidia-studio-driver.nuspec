You can revert to previous driver versions with `choco install` and specifying the version. i.e. `choco install nvidia-studio-driver --version=581.29 -yf`

## Package Parameters

The following package parameters can be set to customize the installation.

  - `/RemoveOtherVersions` - If desired, remove other versions of the NVIDIA display driver from windows after install.
    - Can trigger an unexpected reboot (uncommon)
    - Removes any nvidia display driver that doesn't match the version of the newly installed version, only affects display driver other components are untouched.
    - Can help prevent windows from reverting to a 'newer' driver on reboot if reverting to an older version of the driver.

`choco install nvidia-studio-driver --params "'/RemoveOtherVersions'"`
