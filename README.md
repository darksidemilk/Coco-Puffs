# Coco-Puffs

I'm coo coo for chocolatey package! Repository for my published chocolatey packages. 

## Structuring

There's a sub-folder for each community chocolatey maintained here.
Github actions will be used for CI/CD to auto publish packages as new versions are relased.
Publish on the repo is subject to the Chocolatey review process (see also https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/community-repository/moderation/) which can take time for the final human review managed by volunteers. Please be patient if a new version isn't published right away.
