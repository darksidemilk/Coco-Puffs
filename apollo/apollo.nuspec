# Apollo Game Streaming Server Chocolatey Package

This installs the latest release of the Apollo game streaming server.

## Dependencies Embedded

Running just /S on the installer doesn't always run all install scripts so they are re-run in the chocolateyinstall script from the install path. 
Install script source: 

- https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo/tree/master/src_assets/windows/misc
- https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo/tree/master/src_assets/windows/drivers/sudovda

They are installed to C:\Program Files\Apollo in the scripts and drivers subdirs respectively.

The dependencies installed are:

- ViGEmBus - Virtual Gamepad Emulation Framework - https://vigembus.com/
- SudoVDA - Virtual Display Adapter with HDR support - https://github.com/SudoMaker/SudoVDA
- Adds Apollo to system PATH
- Configures Apollo service to auto start
- Adds firewall rules for Apollo

# Apollo

Apollo is a self-hosted desktop stream host for [Artemis(Moonlight Noir)](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/moonlight-android). Offering low latency, native client resolution, cloud gaming server capabilities with support for AMD, Intel, and Nvidia GPUs for hardware encoding. Software encoding is also available. A web UI is provided to allow configuration and client pairing from your favorite web browser. Pair from the local server or any mobile device.

Major features:

- [x] Built-in Virtual Display with HDR support that matches the resolution/framerate config of your client automatically
- [x] Permission management for clients
- [x] Clipboard sync
- [x] Commands for client connection/disconnection (checkout [Auto pause/resume games](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo/wiki/Auto-pause-resume-games))
- [x] Input only mode

## Usage

Refer to LizardByte's documentation hosted on [Read the Docs](https://docs.lizardbyte.dev/projects/sunshine) for now.
Currently Virtual Display support is Windows only, Linux support is planned and will be implemented in the future.

## About Permission System

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo/wiki/Permission-System)

> [!NOTE]
> The **FIRST** client paired with Apollo will be granted with FULL permissions, then other newly paired clients will only be granted with `View Streams` and `List Apps` permission. If you encounter `Permission Denied` error when trying to launch any app, go check the permission for that device and grant `Launch Apps` permission. The same applies to the situation when you find that you can't move mouse or type with keyboard on newly paired clients, grant the corresponding client `Mouse Input` and `Keyboard Input` permissions.

## About Virtual Display

> [!WARNING]
> ***It is highly recommend to remove any other virtual display solutions from your system and Apollo/Sunshine config, to reduce confusions and compatibility issues.***

> [!NOTE]
> **TL;DR** Just treat your Artemis/Moonlight client like a dedicated PnP monitor with Apollo.

Apollo uses SudoVDA for virtual display. It features auto resolution and framerate matching for your Artemis/Moonlight clients. The virtual display is created upon the stream starts and removed once the app quits. **If you do not see a new virtual display added or removed when the stream starts or stops, there may be a driver misconfiguration, or another persistent virtual display might still be active.**
The virtual display works just like any physically attached monitors with SudoVDA, there's completely no need for a super complicated solution to "fix" resolution configurations for your devices. Unlike all other solutions that reuses one identity or generate a random one each time for any virtual display sessions, **Apollo assigns a fixed identity for each Artemis/Moonlight client, so your display configuration will be automatically remembered and managed by Windows natively.**

[!WARNING]
> **I noticed that some other forks of Sunshine merges on-going PRs from upstream (and without credits to the PR author). Although those features are appealing, but they're unfinished and has loads of potential risks. Please do not use those forks before they address all the security issues for your own safety concerns.**
>
> **Feature in question**: https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/pull/4078
> **Problem**: Communication is not encrpyted, audio stream not client-separated

> [!NOTE]
> If you experience stutters after upgrade to v0.4.x, try revert to v0.3.7-hotfix-1 for now and also report your system configuration to [this issue](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/Apollo/issues/956).
> If you just have upgraded your GPU driver, it's recommended to reboot your computer before staring a new stream.

## Bonus

[Apollo Profile Manager](https://github.com/ClassicOldSong/ApolloProfileManager/releases)

You can use it to automatically save/restore a selection of files for each app, and they're separated for each client. You can use it to swap game settings, mod sets or even save files based on the client, so you don't need to edit game resolution/keymap/modsets every time you change to a different client.
