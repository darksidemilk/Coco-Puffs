# Nvidia Quadro Driver

This is a package that will update you to the latest quadro driver.

## Notes

This will be an automatic package just getting my initial things into the repo for now. Publishing an older version of the driver first 553.62 as I know of some known issues with dental industry cad programs where versions past this aren't supported, and I want to be sure this known working version is available. Will then jump to releasing the latest version via testing the auto update methods.
